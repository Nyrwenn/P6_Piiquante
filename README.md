# This is the readme for the P6_Piiquante API backend

# Installation:
First create a `.env` file.
Into this file, you must have two const which are :
 
MONGO=mongodb+srv://Nyrwenn:P6password@piiquante.cjen8.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority

PassJWT=DONT_SHOW_ME

You are free to modify these two const (if you already have a mongoDB account), and to choose your token for the PassJWT.
Don't forget that these data have to be secret.

# To run the server:
`npm start`, it runs on the PORT 3000.

# Routes
To use this API you can check the documentation on the "Requirements_DW_P6.pdf" file.
